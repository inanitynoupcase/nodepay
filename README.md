## What is Nodepay ?<a name="introduction"></a>

**Nodepay** is **the infrastructure that provides decentralized bandwidth for AI training**. By connecting to the Nodepay Network, you can sell your unused internet to AI companies and provide them access to real time data crawling and information from the public web.

## How does Nodepay work?? <a name="paragraph1"></a>
**Nodepay** transforms your internet connection into a source of passive income by leveraging your unused bandwidth. Itâ€™s a simple concept: most of us have internet bandwidth that we never fully use. Nodepay enables you to sell that surplus to businesses and institutions across multiple sectors, including AI research, financial services, healthcare, and more.

## What is Nodepay Farming Tool? <a name="paragraph3"></a>
The Nodepay Farming Tool is a utility that allows you to simulate multiple computers to farm points for Nodepay using just proxies and a single computer.

For example, typically, you would need to open a browser to earn points from Nodepay. However, with this tool, you can use one account with multiple proxies to simulate multiple devices without consuming significant system resources (or multiple account with multiple proxy and more). Trust me, using Selenium or traditional browsers like Chrome can be much more resource-intensive than you might expect.
## How to using Nodepay Farming Tool? <a name="paragraph4"></a>
1. Login to your dashboard [here](https://app.nodepay.ai/dashboard)
2. Open **Developer Tool** (aka F12 or Inspect) and switch to tab Network
3. Look for **session** on your left and **Headers** on the right side. Scroll down until you find **Authorization**. Copy everything except for **Bearer** or you can use this code on **Console**:
```
console.log(localStorage.getItem('np_token'));
```
5. Fill in your **token.txt** with the data you copied in the previous step.
6. Fill in **proxy.txt** using the format: `protocol://user:pass@ip:port`. (no matter Datacenter proxy or Residential proxy. I recommend HTTP proxy)
7. Runing **nodepay.exe** and enjoy !
